# Data-Science-Probability-and-Statistics-Projects

Implementation of the projects for the DSC 530: Probability and Statistics for Data Science course, of the [MSc in Data Science programme of the University of Cyprus](https://datascience.cy/).

## Covered Topics
The projects mostly focus on fundamental topics of Probability and Statistics in the context of Data Science with its inherent challenges. 

Specifically the following topics are covered:
- Fundamental probability topics (random variables, their distribution functions, expected values, conditioning on certain events and independence)
- Etimatation of certain quantities of interest from observations
- Estimators and properties of estimators (sufficiency, unbiasedness and consistency, which enable the evaluation of their quality with an
emphasis in the framework of big datasets)
- Different types of hypotheses tests, comparison between tests and how to construct confidence ntervals for their estimators

## Implementation in R
The implementation contains both the technical report and R-code, and is located in the **projects-implementation** folder.
